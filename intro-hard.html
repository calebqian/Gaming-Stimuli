<p>Now you are going to play another game. The rule of the game is to find and click two identical shapes (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) with one shape of any kinds in between. When you click the correct two shapes, they will disappear. If not, they will remain unchanged. You have 15 seconds to finish as many pairs as you can. Ready? Click "continue" to play the game.
