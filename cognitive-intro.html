<p>Now you are going to play another game. Click a card to flip it. You will see a number. Then click another one. If the two numbers are identical, they will remain visible; if they are not identical, both of the cards will flip back. Try your best to make as many numbers visible as you can in 15 seconds. Ready? Click "continue" to play the game.
